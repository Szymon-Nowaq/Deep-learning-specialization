# Deep-learning-specialization
Since december 2023 I am following this [course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Specialization includes 5 stages:
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) âœ…
- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning) âœ…
- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning) âœ…
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) ðŸ”„
- [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?specialization=deep-learning) ðŸ”œ
